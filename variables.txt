Notes:
* This file is read by vm. Please do not clobber it.
* If you do not want some any of these variables to be exported
  by 'vm sh' you can comment them out.
* Where not otherwise indicated, default values are found
  in lib/vmrc.

VM_LIB
Where vm lives. You must edit <vm-installpath>/bin/vm to set this.

VM_HOME
If set, vm will cd to this directory (if possible, or die) and
take everything from there. If a configuration file is found in the
current directory but the value of VM_HOME would cause it to be ignored,
an error message is issued instead (but see below).

VM_HOME_OVERRIDES_CWD
Always use the value stored in VM_HOME regardless of what is
found in the current directory.

VM_CONFIG
The name of the per-directory config file.

VM_GLOBAL_CONFIG
The name of the file that has the overall defaults and such.

VM_FMT
The format to use for image files, without the dot.

VM_DATEFMT
The format used for log messages et al. as passed to the 'date' program.
Leave blank to use the system default.

VM_USE_SNAPSHOTS
Set this to 'yes' or use the simple version.

VM_MACHINE_NAME
The name of the game. It is used to prefix basically everything.

VM_MACHINE_ID
Two decimal digits to uniquely identify the machine where free-format
identifiers are not an option. Note that it is interpreted
in different ways in different places. Thusly you can have 100
IDs ranging from 00 to 99 but not anything else.

VM_MACHINE_OWNER
The name of a user account on the guest OS that you or whatever user the
scripts that use vm are running as can ssh into without
supplying a password. *Deep breath* Depending on the setup
the ability to use sudo without a password is probably also
difficult to avoid.

VM_NET_LISTEN
The address of the interface qemu monitor will bind to.
Automatically defaults to 0.0.0.0 (any).

VM_NET_PORT
The port that will be used for qemu monitor.
Automatically defaults to 77${MACHINE_ID}.

VM_NET_HOST
Can be set to the canonical name or ip address of the host that qemu
is reachable under  (see above).
Automatically defaults to 'localhost'.
See also VM_NET_GUEST.

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME_DEFAULT
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME_DEFAULT
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME_DEFAULT
The last part of the name of the image file used for the purpose if
there is not the override. Theses are global defaults to be used
only in the system-wide vmrc. In your local configuration use:

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME
These values, if set, will be used to produce the actual file names
like so:

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEED_FILENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASE_FILENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKING_FILENAME
These contain the final version of the names of the files to be used
and can not be overridden. Please note the absence of quotation marks
below, you can't use spaces or other stuff that needs to be quoted
as part of file names. Nor should you.
- VM_SNAPSHOT_SEED_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME.$VM_FMT
- VM_SNAPSHOT_BASE_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME.$VM_FMT
- VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKING_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME.$VM_FMT
