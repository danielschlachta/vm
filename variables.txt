Notes:
* This file is read by vm. Please do not clobber it.
* If you do not want any of these variables to be exported
  by 'vm sh' you can comment them out.
* Unless indicated otherwise, default values are found
  in lib/vmrc.

VM_LIB
Where vm lives. You must edit <vm-installpath>/bin/vm to set this.

VM_HOME
If set, vm will cd to this directory (if possible, or die) and
take everything from there. If a configuration file is found in the
current directory but the value of VM_HOME would cause it to be ignored,
an error message is issued instead (but see below).

VM_HOME_OVERRIDES_CWD
Always use the value stored in VM_HOME regardless of what is
found in the current directory.

VM_CONFIG
The name of the per-directory config file.

VM_GLOBAL_CONFIG
The name of the file that has the overall defaults and such.

VM_CALLING_DIR
This is passed on to shells opened by vm and contains the original
working directory vm was in when it was called.

VM_FMT
The format to use for image files, without the dot.

VM_DATEFMT
The format used for log messages et al. as passed to the 'date' program.
Leave blank to use the system default.

VM_LOG
If set, most messages that would be generated using the --verbose switch will be logged
to this file instead. The --verbose switch can still be used to display them as well.

VM_ERRLOG
If set, fatal errors will be logged to this file.

VM_USE_SNAPSHOTS
Set this to 'yes' or use the simple version.

VM_MACHINE_NAME
The name of the game. It is used to prefix basically everything.

VM_MACHINE_ID
Two decimal digits to uniquely identify the machine where free-format
identifiers are not an option. Note that it is interpreted
in different ways in different places. Thusly you can have 100
IDs ranging from 00 to 99 but not anything else.

VM_MACHINE_OWNER
Currently only used for issuing commands via ssh. Note that
the user account/home directory is selected doing ssh command line
trickery while the effective user id does not change.
This is important for non-interactive use e.g. init scripts.

VM_NET_LISTEN
The address of the interface qemu monitor will bind to.
Defaults to 0.0.0.0 (any).

VM_NET_PORT
The port that will be used for the qemu monitor.
Defaults to 77${MACHINE_ID}.

VM_NET_HOST
Can be set to the canonical name or ip address of the host that qemu
is reachable under (see above).
Defaults to 'localhost'.
See also VM_NET_GUEST.

VM_NET_GUEST
The hostname or ip of the guest os, defaults to $VM_MACHINE_NAME

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME_DEFAULT
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME_DEFAULT
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME_DEFAULT
The last part of the name of the image file used for the purpose if
it is not overridden. These are global defaults to be used
only in the system-wide vmrc. In your local configuration use:

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME
These values, if set, will be used to produce the actual file names
like so:

VM_SNAPSHOT_SEED_FILENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BASE_FILENAME
VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKING_FILENAME
These contain the final version of the names of the files to be used
and can not be overridden. Please note the absence of quotation marks
below, you can't use spaces or other stuff that needs to be quoted
as part of file names. Nor should you.
- VM_SNAPSHOT_SEED_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_SEEDNAME.$VM_FMT
- VM_SNAPSHOT_BASE_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_BASENAME.$VM_FMT
- VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKING_FILENAME=$VM_MACHINE_NAME-$VM_SNAPSHOT_BACKINGNAME.$VM_FMT
